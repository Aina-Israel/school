    <p>The school started as Ekiti Anglican Girls School, 
        Ado Ekiti on 17th of February 1955 
        and was formally opened on March 15, 1955. There were
         two pioneer teachers and twenty nine students on roll. 
         The school is sited at the direct opposite of Christ's 
         school, Ado Ekiti.
Ekiti Anglican Girls School was merged with Christ's School, Ado 
Ekiti in January 1966 under the leadership of Canon L.D Mason. 
The School then became the Girl's Section of Christ's School 
site (Boy's section). The School was separated from Christ's 
School to become CHRIST'S GIRLS SCHOOL, ADO EKITI in 1979.
In September 2005, Christ's Girls School, Ado Ekiti was split 
into Senior and Junior schools by the then Ekiti State Government
 as a result of the Universal Basic Education Policy of 
 the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p>
