    <h2>Welcome to Christ Boys..</h2>
    <p> <strong About Christ Boys></strong></p>
    <p>Christ’s school boys’ section is governed by a well known man 
        of God in the Anglican Diocese of Ekiti whose name is VENERABLE
         OLUROTIMI OSO EBENEZER. 
The principal of the school who is an Alumnus of the school,
 has been the best the school has ever received as a leader of 
 value and moral knowledge. He has been able to restore the Glory 
 of the school back to its original position.
Christ’s School boys’ section yearly produces at least over
 300 graduating students. The school has recorded a 98% success 
 in the last UNIFIED Examination, and also had over 500 students 
 who passed the Junior WAEC Examination excellently.  <nav>
