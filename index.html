<P> <strong> About The School:</strong>
    Christ School was founded on 30 June 1933 by the British missionary, 
    Archdeacon Henry Dallimore. Originally christened
     'Ekiti Central School,' it began as a co-educational 
     secondary school, taking students into classes V and VI.
      It took the name, 'Christ's School, Ado Ekiti,' 
      following the recommendation of Sir Bernard Henry Bourdillon,
       the Governor of then Northern and Southern Protectorates of Nigeria.
        In 1936, it relocated to its permanent and current site, the Agidimo
         Hills.[2] It was conceived as an attempt to advance secondary school
          education in Ekitiland and Western Nigeria in an 
    atmosphere where discipline, diligence and academic 
    excellence would be nurtured and guaranteed.
