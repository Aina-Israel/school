<p>The school started as Ekiti Anglican Girls School, Ado Ekiti on 17th of February 1955 and was formally opened on March 15, 1955. There were two pioneer teachers and twenty nine students on roll. The school is sited at the direct opposite of Christ's school, Ado Ekiti.</p>
Ekiti Anglican Girls School was merged with Christ's School, Ado Ekiti in January 1966 under the leadership of Canon L.D Mason. The School then became the Girl's Section of Christ's School site (Boy's section). The School was separated from Christ's School to become CHRIST'S GIRLS SCHOOL, ADO EKITI in 1979.
In September 2005, Christ's Girls School, Ado Ekiti was split into Senior and Junior schools by the then Ekiti State Government as a result of the Universal Basic Education Policy of the Federal Government of Nigeria.
